# UX Markup Literals 

This article covers in detail how numbers, vectors, colors and strings are interpreted in UX Markup.

## Numbers

Any numeric type (`float`, `int`, `double`, `Size` etc.) can be represented in the same notation as numbers in JavaScript or `double` in Uno, with period (`.`) as optional decimal separator.

Valid numbers:

	1
	1.3
	13
	.4

Example:

	<Panel Width="10.5" />

## Units

Some properties allow units `%` (percent), `pt` (points) or `px` (pixels). This is noted by simply placing the unit after the number literal.

Examples:
	
	<Panel Width="50%" Height="200px" />

The default unit is `unspecified`, which unless involved in arithmetic with a value with a specified unit, is interpreted as `pt` (points)

## Vectors

Vector types (`float2`, `float3`, `float4`, `Size2`, etc.) can be noted in various ways, which is interpreted according to the the following rules.

If a *single number* value is provided, this value is repeated for each component. 

For example;

	<Panel Margin="10" />

is equivalent to:

	<Panel Margin="10, 10, 10, 10" />

If *two numbers* (`X` and `Y`), separated by a comma (`,`) are provided then these two components are repeated as [`X`, `Y`, `X`, `Y`] up to the size of the target vector, for example;

	<Panel Margin="4, 8" />

is equivalent to:

	<Panel Margin="4, 8, 4, 8" />

This means in the case of `Margin`, two components specify horizontal (left/right) and vertical (top/bottom) margin respectively.

If *three numbers* (`X`, `Y` and `Z`) separated by commas (`,`) are provided, then these components are padded with an extra `1.0` if needed, that is:

	<Panel Color="1,0,1" />

is equivalent to:

	<Panel Color="1,0,1,1" />

This means in the case of `Color`, the alpha channel (`W`) will be set to `1` by default, giving an opaque color if not otherwise specified.

## Vectors in expressions

To write a vector as part of an expression, make sure to encapsulate the vector in parentheses to make it parse correctly:

	<Panel Color="(1,0,1,1) / {fadeValue}" />

## Size Vectors

Some properties are of type `Size2` and support separate units for `X` and `Y`. An example of such a property is `Element.Offset`. These values are noted like vectors, where each vector component may specify a unit:

	<Panel Offset="10%, 20px" />

## Colors

Colors are represented by the type `float4` (or `float3` if no alpha channel). This means they can be noted the same way as vectors (see above).

To ease working with colors, `float4` and `float3` vectors may also be denoted in *hexadecimal* notation using the `#` sign:

	<Panel Color="#18f" />

Hexadecimal colors (vectors) can be given with 3, 4, 6 or 8 hexadecimal digits, interpreted as follows:

* `#RGB` (or `#XYZ`)
* `#RGBA` (or `#XYZW`)
* `#RRGGBB` (or `#XXYYZZ`)
* `#RRGGBBAA` (or `#XXYYZZWW`)

When the alpha channel (`A` or `W`) is ommited, an alpha value of 1.0 (`f` or `ff`) is assumed.

## Strings

String properties are parsed a bit differently from other properties. Strings properties are by default treated as raw string literals. 

	<Text Value="Hello, World!" />

To inject a binding expression, we simply place a curly brace expression in the middle of the string, like this:

	<Text Value="Hello, {username}!" />

To compute a string from an expression, use the *inline expression* syntax:

	<Text Value="Hello {= toLower({username})}" />
