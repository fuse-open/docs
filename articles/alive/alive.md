# Alive UX Kit

Alive is a suite of UX components included with [Professional and Custom plans](https://fusetools.com/plans) of Fuse.

## Getting started

To include Alive in our project, we'll begin by installing the necessary dependencies.
Open up a command line shell (Terminal on macOS, `cmd` on Windows) and run the following commands:

	uno install Fuse.Charting
	uno install Fuse.UXKits.Alive

Then, we need to add a package reference to `Fuse.UXKits.Alive` and `Fuse.Charting` in our `.unoproj`.
It should look something like the following.

	{
		"Packages": [
			"Fuse",
			"FuseJS",
			"Fuse.Charting",
			"Fuse.UXKits.Alive"
		],
		"Includes": [
			"*"
		]
	}


Now, there is a small bit of setup that is required for themes to work properly.
Alive provides both a [LightTheme](api:alive/lighttheme) and a [DarkTheme](api:alive/darktheme).

We'll add a [Alive.FallbackTheme](api:alive/fallbacktheme) inside a panel at the root of our App.
This sets up default theme colors and makes sure we always have one of the themes enabled at any point in the UX tree.

	<App>
		<Panel>
			<Alive.FallbackTheme />

			<Panel>
				<!-- app content -->
			</Panel>
		</Panel>
	</App>


**Note:** Alive.FallbackTheme is explicitly a [LightTheme](api:alive/lighttheme).
To make the entire app be [DarkTheme](api:alive/darktheme), enclose it within a @Panel together with the rest of the app's content.

	<App>
		<Panel>
			<Alive.FallbackTheme />

			<Panel>
				<Alive.DarkTheme />

				<!-- app content -->
			</Panel>
		</Panel>
	</App>


See [themes](themes.md) for more info on how to work with themes.
