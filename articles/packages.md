# Community packages

This is a curated list of **third party** Fuse packages created and submitted to us by the community. Fuse provides no official support or quality control on these packages. Use at your own risk.

Packages are licensed by you directly from the author, see license file in each repo for details.

> **Note:** Fuse is working on official tooling to automate publishing and installation of packages. In the mean time we can install packages manually.

## Installing a package

Packages can be all sorts of things; examples, libraries, plugins or tools. Installation steps differ between packages. Follow the installation instructions in README for each package, however - packages are commonly installed simply by doing a `git clone` and adding a project reference in your project's `.unoproj` file with a relative path.
