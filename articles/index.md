# What is Fuse?

Fuse is a set of user experience development tools that unify design, prototyping and implementation of high quality mobile apps.

In other words: Fuse takes you all the way from idea to deployed app. 

## Unique Tech Stack

Fuse introduces UX Markup, a declarative-reactive XML-based language for creating native, responsive and smoothly animated interactive components for iOS and Android. UX is easy to learn, fun to write and incredibly powerful.

UX Markup gives you unified access to the three most powerful UI technologies available in phones: each platform's native UI components, ultra-fast OpenGL-based rendering and flexible vector-based graphics, all wrapped in intuitive declarative abstractions.

UX Markup compiles down to C++ for optimal native performance on mobile devices. Fuse is powered by Uno, a lightweight C# dialect that compiles to C++, and has seamless interoperability with Objective-C (iOS) and Java (Android) where needed. 

UX Markup components can be dropped into existing native apps, or used to build stand-alone cross-platform apps within Fuse by adding business logic in JavaScript. 

Fuse values *non-verbosity*, *reactive programming* and *expressiveness*. Fuse strives to design the most intuitive APIs out there to make UX development accessible to all creatives.

### Let's go!

Depending on your background (experienced coder, rookie coder, experienced design ninja or otherwise), some things will be obvious and some things will be new to you.

A good way to gain an overview is by [following our quickstart tutorial](basics/quickstart.md). There's also a wide range of ready-to-run examples [on our Examples-page](/examples), as well as a (constantly growing) list of [tutorials on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdlqWm6b-XALJgM3fGa4q95Yipsgb8Q1o).

The side-menu covers most topics you'd need to learn Fuse, such as [setting up navigation](navigation/navigation.html), [working with layout](layout/layout.html), how you [animate elements](fuse/animations/animator.html) and a whole lot more.

Connect with the Fuse developers and our amazing community in [the forums](/community/forums) or  in the [Slack group](http://slackcommunity.fusetools.com/).

Have fun!
