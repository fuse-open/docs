# What is Fuse Open?

Fuse is a set of user experience development tools for Windows and OSX that unify design, prototyping and implementation of high quality mobile apps on iOS and Android.

## Unique Tech Stack

Fuse introduces UX Markup, a declarative-reactive XML-based language for creating native, responsive and smoothly animated interactive components for iOS and Android. UX is easy to learn, fun to write and incredibly powerful.

UX Markup gives you unified access to the three most powerful UI technologies available in phones: each platform's native UI components, ultra-fast OpenGL-based rendering and flexible vector-based graphics, all wrapped in intuitive declarative abstractions.

UX Markup compiles down to C++ for optimal native performance on mobile devices. It does this through Uno, a lightweight C# dialect that compiles to C++, and has seamless interoperability with Objective-C (iOS) and Java (Android) where needed. 

UX Markup components can be dropped into existing native apps, or used to build stand-alone cross-platform apps within Fuse by adding business logic in JavaScript. 

Fuse values *brevity*, *reactive programming* and *expressiveness*. We strive to design the most intuitive and powerful APIs out there to make UX development accessible to all creatives.

### Let's go!

The best way to gain a quick, early overview is by [following our quickstart tutorial](basics/quickstart.md). There's also a wide range of ready-to-run examples [on our Examples-page](https://examples.fusetools.com/), as well as a (constantly growing) list of [tutorials on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdlqWm6b-XALJgM3fGa4q95Yipsgb8Q1o).

The side-menu covers most topics you'd need to learn Fuse, such as [setting up navigation](navigation/navigation.html), [working with layout](layout/layout.html), how you [animate elements](fuse/animations/animator.html) and a whole lot more.
