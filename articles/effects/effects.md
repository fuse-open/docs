# Effects

Fuse has the ability to render a set of visual effects that can be added to most controls. It is important to understand that in order for these to work, you need to be in graphics mode; native themes are limited in their ability to render these effects.

Fuse currently has these effects:

[subclass Fuse.Effects.BasicEffect]

**Note:** Some effects are performance intensive. You should therefore exercise caution when using multiple effects at the same time.
