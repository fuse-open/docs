## Introduction

In the [last chapter](multiple-hikes.md), we extended our Edit Hike view by adding a second view to select which hike we're going to edit. This was a big step forward, but now it's about time we start splitting up our code into smaller, reusable _components_ so that our code will be easier to manage as our project grows. This will teach us how to utilize important tools that Fuse provides for managing the complexity of real-world app projects.

More specifically, what we'll do in this chapter is separate out our two views - the hike selector view, which will become our _home page_, and the edit hike view, which will become our _edit hike page_.

Now, because this is a lot of ground to cover, this part of the tutorial will only go over how to split our view into separate components, _not_ how we'll fit them back together and develop the flow of our app.

The final code for this chapter is available [here](https://github.com/fusetools/hikr/tree/models-chapter-3).

## Transforming the Edit Hike view into a component

At this point it is a good idea to move our components into their own files so that we eventually can design a navigation flow between them. We'll do this in small steps. First, we'll want to create a new folder in our project called `Pages`:

```
$ tree
.
|- MainView.ux
|- App.js
|- hikr.unoproj
|- Pages
```

Inside this new folder, we'll create a new file called `EditHikePage.ux`. Inside there, we'll place the following code:

```
<Page ux:Class="EditHikePage"></Page>
```

Our directory tree should now look a bit like this:

```
$ tree
.
|- MainView.ux
|- App.js
|- hikr.unoproj
|- Pages
   |- EditHikePage.ux
```

Now before we move on, I need to explain a couple things. Let's take another look at our new `EditHikePage.ux` file's contents:

```
<Page ux:Class="EditHikePage"></Page>
```

At first glance, it looks like we're just creating a @Page with a funny `ux:Class` property and nothing in it. But what's a @Page exactly? And what's with this `ux:Class` stuff?

To answer the first question, a @Page is basically a special kind of UI element that will participate in navigation. We don't actually _have_ to use a @Page here; we could just as well use a `Panel`, a `Button`, or something else entirely. But it's generally considered best practice to use a @Page if you're going to use the component with navigation specifically, which we'll do a bit later in this chapter and the following one.

As for the second question, `ux:Class` means that instead of creating an _instance_ of a @Page, we're creating a _class_ that _extends_ the @Page class. If you've ever done some object-oriented programming before, this terminology will sound very familiar. If not, it may sound a little strange, but it's actually a pretty simple concept to grasp. Basically, we can think of a _class_ as a _kind_ of element, and an _instance_ is _an element of that kind_. For example, @Button is a class, and when we say `<Button />` in UX, we're making an instance of the @Button class. @Button describes how a button element should look and feel, and `<Button />` describes that an actual @Button element exists in our view.

But what does _extend_ mean in this context? It simply means that we're going to make our own class that is basically the same as a given class, but we'll add a few things of our own. In our case, we still want to end up with a @Page, but we want some extra stuff on it as well (the stuff that's specific to our view). So, we'll say `<Page ux:Class="EditHikePage" />`, which means we're going to create our own class called `EditHikePage` that extends the @Page class. Then, whenever we want to use this class (create an instance), instead of saying `<Page />` and putting all of our custom stuff inside it, we can simply say `<EditHikePage />`.

Now that we've understood the basic contents of this file, it's time to migrate the code we want in our view over from `MainView.ux`. If we take a look at that file, we'll see something like this:

```
<App Model="App">
	<ClientPanel>
		<ScrollView>
			<StackPanel>
				<Each Items="{hikes}">
					<Button Text="{name}" Clicked="{chooseHike}" />
				</Each>

				<Text>Name:</Text>
				<TextBox Value="{hike.name}" />

				<Text>Location:</Text>
				<TextBox Value="{hike.location}" />

				<Text>Distance (km):</Text>
				<TextBox Value="{hike.distance}" InputHint="Decimal" />

				<Text>Rating:</Text>
				<TextBox Value="{hike.rating}" InputHint="Integer" />

				<Text>Comments:</Text>
				<TextView Value="{hike.comments}" TextWrapping="Wrap" />
			</StackPanel>
		</ScrollView>
	</ClientPanel>
</App>
```

Looking at the top-level parts of this file, we first see our @App, and then a @ClientPanel. All of the other contents are what make up our view specifically. So these are the parts we'll want to move over to our `EditHikePage.ux` file, inside the @Page. This will look something like this:

MainView.ux:

```
<App Model="App">
	<ClientPanel>
	</ClientPanel>
</App>
```

EditHikePage.ux:

```
<Page ux:Class="EditHikePage">
	<ScrollView>
		<StackPanel>
			<Each Items="{hikes}">
				<Button Text="{name}" Clicked="{chooseHike}" />
			</Each>

			<Text>Name:</Text>
			<TextBox Value="{hike.name}" />

			<Text>Location:</Text>
			<TextBox Value="{hike.location}" />

			<Text>Distance (km):</Text>
			<TextBox Value="{hike.distance}" InputHint="Decimal" />

			<Text>Rating:</Text>
			<TextBox Value="{hike.rating}" InputHint="Integer" />

			<Text>Comments:</Text>
			<TextView Value="{hike.comments}" TextWrapping="Wrap" />
		</StackPanel>
	</ScrollView>
</Page>
```

If we save these files, our preview will update, but this time, our contents will vanish! The reason for this is simple - we've only created the `EditHikePage` class, but we haven't _used_ it anywhere! To fix this, we'll just add an _instance_ of the `EditHikePage` class inside the @ClientPanel in `MainView.ux`, like so:

```
<App>
	<ClientPanel>
		<EditHikePage />
	</ClientPanel>
</App>
```

Notice how this looks just like we had used any other class that comes standard in Fuse - but this time, it's a class we've created ourselves! If we save `MainView.ux`, we'll see that our view shows up again in preview. Awesome!

## Separating our home page

At this point, our `EditHikePage` class is actually two components in one - a hike selector, and a hike editor. Generally, when making components, it's a good idea to make sure they're a simple as possible, and that they only represent one _thing_, like a single view. What we'll do next is to separate the selector view into its own class, which we'll call the `HomePage`.

Now that we've basically done this before, this second time should be a little easier. First, we'll create a blank page class that will become our home page, in a file called `HomePage.ux` in our `Pages` directory:

```
<Page ux:Class="HomePage"></Page>
```

Next, we'll migrate the home page-specific UX code from `EditHikePage.ux` into `HomePage.ux`. Specifically, we're after the @Each tag that displayed the `hikes` collection:

```
<Each Items="{hikes}">
	<Button Text="{name}" Clicked="{chooseHike}" />
</Each>
```

So let's go ahead and move that over:

```
<Page ux:Class="HomePage">
	<Each Items="{hikes}">
		<Button Text="{name}" Clicked="{chooseHike}" />
	</Each>
</Page>
```

Also, since we're going to be displaying a bunch of these hikes, we'll want to place them inside a @StackPanel. It's a good idea to also have that inside a @ScrollView, so we'll set that up too:

```
<Page ux:Class="HomePage">
	<ScrollView>
		<StackPanel>
			<Each Items="{hikes}">
				<Button Text="{name}" Clicked="{chooseHike}" />
			</Each>
		</StackPanel>
	</ScrollView>
</Page>
```

And that's it! At this point, our page should be ready for display.

## Displaying our home page

By now, we've got multiple pages, and we'll need a way to display them and navigate between them. In Fuse, this is handled by the @Navigator component. Navigation in general will need a proper introduction, and we'll want to take our time learning how to do it properly, so we'll take a closer look at it in the next chapter.

For now, to keep things simple, we'll use a @PageControl instead. A @PageControl is great for cases where we want to have a few pages side-by-side that we'll to swipe between, which is just fine for initially displaying our two pages.

So, if we take a look at `MainView.ux`, it currently looks something like this:

```
<App>
	<ClientPanel>
		<EditHikePage />
	</ClientPanel>
</App>

```

Let's place the `EditHikePage` instance inside a @PageControl, like so:

```
<App>
	<ClientPanel>
		<PageControl>
			<EditHikePage />
		</PageControl>
	</ClientPanel>
</App>
```

Now, all we have to do is add a `HomePage` instance inside our @PageControl as well. Because it's the home page, let's place it above our existing `EditHikePage` instance:

```
<App>
	<ClientPanel>
		<PageControl>
			<HomePage />
			<EditHikePage />
		</PageControl>
	</ClientPanel>
</App>
```

And now, when we save all of this, our new `HomePage` will be displayed, and we can swipe right to reveal the `EditHikePage` as well. Selecting hikes also works exactly as it did before. Cool!

## Our progress so far

Phew, we've covered a lot of ground here! At this point, we've got our two views separated into components and displayed side-by-side in a @PageControl. This is how they look:

`HomePage.ux`:

![End of chapter result](../../media/hikr/chapter-3/homepage.png)

`EditHikePage.ux`:

![End of chapter result](../../media/hikr/chapter-3/edithikepage.png)

And here's what the code for all of our various files looks like. It's a few more files now, but they're much simpler now in isolation:

`hikr.unoproj`:
```
{
  "RootNamespace":"",
  "Packages": [
    "Fuse",
    "FuseJS"
  ],
  "Includes": [
      "*",
      "**.js:FuseJS"
  ]
}
```

`MainView.ux`:
```
<App>
	<ClientPanel>
		<PageControl>
			<HomePage />
			<EditHikePage />
		</PageControl>
	</ClientPanel>
</App>
```

`App.js`
```
class Hike {
	constructor(name, location, distance, rating, comments) {
		this.name = name;
		this.location = location;
		this.distance = distance;
		this.rating = rating;
		this.comments = comments;
	}
}

export default class App {
	constructor() {
		this.hike = new Hike(
			"Tricky Trails",
			"Lakebed, Utah",
			10.4,
			4,
			"This hike was nice and hike-like. Glad I didn't bring a bike."
		);
		this.hikes = [
			new Hike(
				"Tricky Trails",
				"Lakebed, Utah",
				10.4,
				4,
				"This hike was nice and hike-like. Glad I didn't bring a bike."
			),
			new Hike(
				"Mondo Mountains",
				"Black Hills, South Dakota",
				20.86,
				3,
				"Not the best, but would probably do again. Note to self: don't forget the sandwiches next time."
			),
			new Hike(
				"Pesky Peaks",
				"Bergenhagen, Norway",
				8.2,
				5,
				"Short but SO sweet!!"
			),
			new Hike(
				"Rad Rivers",
				"Moriyama, Japan",
				12.3,
				4,
				"Took my time with this one. Great view!"
			),
			new Hike(
				"Dangerous Dirt",
				"Cactus, Arizona",
				19.34,
				2,
				"Too long, too hot. Also that snakebite wasn't very fun."
			)
		];
	}

	chooseHike(arg) {
		this.hike = arg.data;
	}
}
```


`Pages/EditHikePage.ux`:
```
<Page ux:Class="EditHikePage">
	<ScrollView>
		<StackPanel>
			<Text Value="{name}" />

			<Text>Name:</Text>
			<TextBox Value="{name}" />

			<Text>Location:</Text>
			<TextBox Value="{location}" />

			<Text>Distance (km):</Text>
			<TextBox Value="{distance}" InputHint="Decimal" />

			<Text>Rating:</Text>
			<TextBox Value="{rating}" InputHint="Integer" />

			<Text>Comments:</Text>
			<TextView Value="{comments}" TextWrapping="Wrap" />
		</StackPanel>
	</ScrollView>
</Page>
```

`Pages/HomePage.ux`:
```
<Page ux:Class="HomePage">
	<ScrollView>
		<StackPanel>
			<Each Items="{hikes}">
				<Button Text="{name}" Clicked="{chooseHike}" />
			</Each>
		</StackPanel>
	</ScrollView>
</Page>
```

## What's next

Now that we've got our two views separated into different components, it is time to take a closer look at how we do navigation in Fuse. In the [next chapter](navigation-and-routing.md) we'll start creating a propert _flow_ through our app, and learn how we can create separate models per page to make our app even more structured. So when you're ready, let's [move on](navigation-and-routing.md)!

The final code for this chapter is available [here](https://github.com/fusetools/hikr/tree/models-chapter-3).
