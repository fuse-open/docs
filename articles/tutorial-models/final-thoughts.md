## We're finished!

Whew, with the [previous chapter](splash-screen.md) complete, we've made it to the end of our hikr app! While building the app, we've hopefully gotten a taste of quite a few different aspects of Fuse. Our goal with this tutorial was to cover the following:

- Best practices for structuring an app in Fuse
- Making changes to data and communicating those changes with a backend
- How and when to build reusable components
- Combining components with routing and navigation

And we think we've done so, all while working on a real project!

## What's next

Even though we've covered a lot of ground, there's always more to learn and cool new things to try. At this point, we should be ready to digest the multitude of [examples](/examples), [docs](/docs), and [reference material](articles:reference) we have available. We also have a couple different video tutorial formats that we upload regularly; one focused on [learning Fuse from the ground up](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdlqWm6b-XALJgM3fGa4q95Yipsgb8Q1o) and another focused on [diving deeper by building specific components](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdlqWm6b-XAJX9MZ04oJ43NeP1zVFmC4a), so be sure to check those out as well.

And of course, if you have any questions/comments or just want to chat, hit up our [community](https://www.fusetools.com/community) section and/or [contact us](/contact)! Our [forums](/community/forums) and [slack community](https://slackcommunity.fusetools.com/) are particularly helpful.

We'll also be working on a number of "tracks" that continue where we've left off here, and will cover things like adding specific backends, improving certain editors, adding animations, and more. These are currently being worked on, and will be added as they're completed. So stay tuned for those!

Finally, thanks for checking out Fuse and following along with this tutorial. We hope you had fun building this app and learned a ton. We can't wait to see what you build with Fuse!
