# Atom plugin installation

> *Note:* We also provide a [plugin for Sublime Text 3](sublime-plugin.md).

Make sure you've installed [Atom](https://atom.io/) first.

Note that you only need to install the plugin via the dashboard *or* the command line, not both.

## From Atom's settings

Open [Atom's settings view](http://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/atom-basics/#settings-and-preferences), and navigate to the "Install" section.

From there, search for the `fuse` package and click Install, as shown below.

## From the command line

Run the following command:

	apm install fuse

	
That's it! You're now ready to start using Atom with Fuse.
