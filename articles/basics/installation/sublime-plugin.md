# Sublime Text 3 plugin installation

> *Note:* We also provide a [plugin for Atom](atom-plugin.md) and [Visual Studo Code](visual-studio-code-plugin.md).

The Sublime plugin can be installed via the Fuse main menu or the command line.

## From the Fuse main menu

Use the "Tools -> Setup Guide" menu option.

## From the command line

Run the following command:

	fuse install sublime-plugin

That's it! You're now ready to start using Sublime Text 3 with Fuse.
