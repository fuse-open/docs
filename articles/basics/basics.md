# Fuse Basics

Just found out about Fuse? This guide is for you!

In this guide, we will look at how you [install Fuse](installation.md) on both [Windows](installation/setup-install-win.md) and [macOS](installation/setup-install-osx.md). Then, after a [quick introduction](quickstart.md), we will have a look at important pieces of Fuse, such as:

 * [Preview and export](preview-and-export.md)
 * [Creating components](../componentization.md)
 * [Uno projects](uno-projects.md)

Also, be sure to check out our end-to-end tutorial, where we'll learn many of Fuse's core concepts by building a hike tracking app called hikr:
 * [hikr tutorial](/tutorial/tutorial.md)

There are also some general overviews:

 * [UX Markup reference](../ux-markup/ux-markup.md)
 * [Feature overview](feature-overview.md)

Stuck? Head over to the [forums](/community) and ask away!
