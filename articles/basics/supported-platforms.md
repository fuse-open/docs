# Supported platforms

## Operating system
* macOS 10.10 (_Yosemite_) and newer, but macOS 11.x (_Big Sur_) is recommended.
* Windows 7 and newer

Please note that beta versions of both macOS and Windows are currently not officially supported.

## Hardware
An OpenGL 2.1-capable GPU is required. Intel GMA is an example of a GPU that is _not_ sufficient.

Please note that some computers have multiple GPUs, and that [a problem with Windows](http://support.displaylink.com/forums/287786-displaylink-feature-suggestions/suggestions/15869604-fix-some-applications-not-running-on-laptop-gpu) might cause it to pick the wrong one. If this happens to you, please try to disable the low end GPU, as described in the linked article.


**Fuse currently exports to:**

 * Android 4.1 (_Jelly Bean_, API level 16) and newer.
 * iOS 9.0 and newer.
