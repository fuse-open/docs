# Fuse Docs

## Writing documentation

### TLDR

All PRs should be made to one of the current release branches, never directly to master. There are two active release branches at once with names corresponding to the release branches on fuselibs (e.g. `release-0.45`).
The release branch corresponding to the current fuselibs release, will be regularly merged to master.

If you're unsure of which are the current release branches, ask in the #content or #docs channel.

When making pull requests, base your branch on one of the two latest release branches, depending on whether you want your changes public asap or if they should go with the next release.

### Detailed descriptions

Changes need to be made on the right branch. See the [Documentation Procedure guide](https://github.com/fusetools/fuse-docs/wiki/Documentation-Procedure) which describes how these branches are laid-out and which one you should be making changes on. For more info, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/fusetools/fuse-docs/wiki).

## Filing tickets

Tickets related to API docs and articles should go here. Tickets related to examples should go on https://github.com/fusetools/example-docs. Feel free to add whatever labels you feel are appropriate, but leave the ticket unassigned.
