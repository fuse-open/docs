      "full": "Specifies what the movement should be relative to.\n\nBy default, when we specify `X` and `Y` offsets the @Move animator for example, the values are\nunderstood to be points in the local coordinate system. However, sometimes we need to\nspecify a distance that are not known at design time, but is relative to the size of something else.\nThis is where this property comes in handy.\n\nThere are multiple options for this property:\n\n * `Local` Moves the given amount of points in the X and/or Y direction.\n * `Size` Moves the given amount times the size of the element. So X=\"1\" moves the element by its entire width in the X direction.\n * `ParentSize` Same as `Size` but uses the elements parents size instead.\n * `PositionChange` Used in response to a @(LayoutAnimation) to move the element by the amount of change in position within it's parent.\n * `WorldPositionChange` Used in response to a @(LayoutAnimation) to move the element by the amount of change in position relative to the entire display.\n * `Keyboard` Moves the element relative to the size of the keyboard.\n * `LayoutChange` Deprecated. Use `PositionChange` instead.\n\nFor advanced use cases, you can also implement your own @ITranslationMode and assign to this property."
