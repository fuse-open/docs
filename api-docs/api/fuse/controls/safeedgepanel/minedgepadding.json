It may not be necessary to add extra padding in such layouts. Instead you can use `MinEdgePadding` to say how much visual padding is required as a minimum. If the safe area already covers that space no more padding is added. If the safe area isn't large enough then more padding is added.\n\n_This is not appropriate for all layouts, nor is it guaranteed to be pleasing on all devices. You should always test on several different models._\n\nNote that `ExtraPadding` is added after this minimum is applied."
