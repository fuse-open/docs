Instead, components can listen to this event\nto get access to all the names in the scope of the closure.\n\nExample with NGUX syntax:\n\n    <Panel ux:Name=\"foo\" />\n    <Closure (Ready)=\"nodeReady($event)\" />\n\nAnd then in the TypeScript component:\n\n    nodeReady(e) {\n        e.foo // holds a reference to the Panel above\n    }"
