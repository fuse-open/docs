In these cases,\none could expect one of two things to happen;\n  1. the animation plays from the start as soon as the trigger is rooted.\n  2. the trigger jumps instantly to the end of the animation.\n\nOne can use the `Bypass` property to differentiate between these. The default is `Bypass=\"Standard\"`,\nwhich corresponds to case 2. If one wants the effect of case 2, one can use `Bypass=\"Never\"` instead."
