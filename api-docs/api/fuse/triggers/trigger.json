      "full": "Triggers are the main tools for interaction response, transitions and animation in Fuse.\n\nTriggers are objects that can be used in UX markup that detect events, gestures, other user input or\nchanges of state in your app, and performs animations and actions in response.\n\nWhen a trigger is *activated*, it performs a *timeline of actions* based on what objects you put inside\nthe trigger tag.\n\nTriggers can contain the following types of child-nodes in UX Markup:\n\n* @Animators that animate properties, transforms or effects when the trigger is active\n* @Actions that perform actions with permanent effects, or call back to JavaScript when the trigger activates.\n* @Nodes (visuals, behaviors, other triggers) that are added to the parent visual while the trigger is active.\n* @Resources (nodes marked with `ux:Key=\"your_key\"`), which overrides `{Resource your_key}` for the parent scope while the trigger is active.\n\n> See the [remarks section](#section-remarks) at the bottom of this page for more information\n\n## Available triggers in Fuse\n\n[subclass Fuse.Triggers.Trigger]",
      "remarks": "## Rest state and deviation\n\nThe default layout and configuration of UX markup elements is called the rest state. Triggers define deviations from this rest state.\n\nEach trigger knows how to \"un-apply\" its own animation to return to the rest state, even if interrupted mid-animation. This is great because \nit means animation is completely separated from the logical state of your program, greatly reducing the complexity of dealing with combined\nanimation on multiple devices, screen sizes, with real data and real user input.\n\n\n## Pulse triggers\n\nPulse triggers detect one-off events such as @Clicked or @Tapped, and play their timeline once. A typical\nuse case is to do a @Callback to JavaScript:\n\n\t<Panel Color=\"Blue\">\n\t\t<Tapped>\n\t\t\t<Callback Handler=\"{panelTapped}\" />\n\t\t</Tapped>\n\t</Panel>\n\nPulse triggers typically have names that are past-tense verbs.\n\n## While-triggers\n\nTriggers with names starting with `While...` are sustained triggers that activate under certain conditions, and remain active until that \ncondition goes away. \n\nFor example @WhilePressed activates while the containing visual is pressed by a pointer, and deactivates when the pointer is released.\n\n\t<Panel Color=\"Red\" ux:Name=\"panel\">\n\t\t<WhilePressed>\n\t\t\t<Scale Factor=\"0.9\" Duration=\"0.2\" Easing=\"BackOut\" />\n\t\t\t<Change panel.Color=\"Blue\" Delay=\"0.2\" Duration=\"0.2\" Easing=\"CubicOut\" />\n\t\t</WhilePressed>\n\t</Panel>\n\nThe containing timeline starts plaing from the beginning when a pointer is pressed, and sustains the end state of the animation while the\npointer remains pressed. If the pointer is released in the middle of the animation, the progress is cancelled and recedes naturally from \nits progress at the time of the release.\n\n### Animation-triggers\n\nTriggers with names ending in `...Animation` are specialized for certain controls. They map the logical progress of the control to the progress of the animation.\n\nFor example, the progress of a @ScrollingAnimation is tied to the relative scroll position of a @ScrollView. When scrolled to the start of the progress is 0, and when scrolled to the end the progress is 1.\n\nThe progress here \"seeks\" to the target value. For example, a sudden jump in the @ScrollView position will result in a sudden jump in the trigger animations. This ensures the trigger progress is tied precisely to the user input.\n\nThe @Animator.Delay and @Animator.Duration settings of animators are respected in `...Animation` triggers, but only as relative values (they are normalized over the range of 0...1 to match the progress).\n\n## Bypass\n\nWhen a trigger is rooted already in its active state it executes in \"bypass\" mode. This will not trigger any pulse actions, and it will skip over animations, simply putting them in their final state.\n\nThis default can be override by specifying `Byass=\"Never\"` on a trigger.\n\nVarious actions and functions also offer the option to use a bypass mode in the transition. These work in the same way by skipping animations and not triggering and pulse actions.",

There are however\nanimations that require a different set of animators when animating back from the active state. For this purpose\none can bind a new set of animators to the `BackwardAnimation` property like so:\n\n    <Panel Width=\"100\" Height=\"100\" Color=\"#00b2ee\">\n        <WhilePressed>\n            <Rotate Degrees=\"90\" Duration=\"0.5\" />\n            <Scale Factor=\"1.5\" Duration=\"1\" Easing=\"QuadraticInOut\" />\n            <TriggerAnimation ux:Binding=\"BackwardAnimation\">\n                <Scale Factor=\"1.5\" Duration=\"1\" Easing=\"QuadraticInOut\" />\n            </TriggerAnimation>\n        </WhilePressed>\n    </Panel>\n\nIn this example, the @Panel only rotates when pressed.
