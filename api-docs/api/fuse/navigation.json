This route consists of one or many parts, which each consist of a string path that\nidentifies a target to navigate to, and optionally, some data to send to this target when navigating to it.\n\nWhen a `Router` receives a route, it will recursively perform navigation for the different parts of the route.\nFor each part, it will search its immediate UX tree to locate a router outlet that will use this part's string path to navigate to part of the app.\nThis could represent, for example, the template key of a template in a @Navigator, or the name of a @Page in a @PageControl.\n\nA router can go directly between routes with `goto`, or navigate heirarchically using `push` and `goBack`.\n\nTypically, an app will use a single, global `Router` instance which will work from the @App root, and represents a single _navigation context_ for the entire app.\nIt's possible, however, to create separate routers for different localized parts of the UX tree, which can be useful if, for example, a different history needs to be\nkept for part of the app.\n\n## Example\n\nThe following example illustrates a basic navigation setup using a @Router and @Navigator.\nFor a complete introduction and proper examples of Fuse's navigation system, see the [Navigation guide](/docs/navigation/navigation).\n\n    <JavaScript>\n        module.exports = {\n            gotoFirst: function() { router.goto(\"firstPage\"); },\n            gotoSecond: function() { router.goto(\"secondPage\"); }\n        };\n    </JavaScript>\n\n    <Router ux:Name=\"router\" />\n\n    <DockPanel>\n        <Navigator DefaultTemplate=\"firstPage\">\n            <Page ux:Template=\"firstPage\">\n                <Text Alignment=\"Center\">This is the first page.</Text>\n            </Page>\n            <Page ux:Template=\"secondPage\">\n                <Text Alignment=\"Center\">This is the second page.</Text>\n            </Page>\n        </Navigator>\n\n        <Grid Dock=\"Bottom\" Columns=\"1*,1*\">\n            <Button Text=\"First page\" Padding=\"20\" Clicked=\"{gotoFirst}\" />\n            <Button Text=\"Second page\" Padding=\"20\" Clicked=\"{gotoSecond}\" />\n        </Grid>\n    </DockPanel>\n\n## Page Navigation Order\n\nThe history of the router follows the standard history ordering, newest routes are at the front of the history, older routes at the back.\n\nThe router however does not decide on the navigation order of the pages in the individual controls, as described in [Navigation Order](articles:navigation/navigationorder.md). This is controlled by each outlet being used."
