      "full": "Modifies the scale of the mapping from page progress to trigger progress.\n\nThe progress of these triggers is based on the page progress in the navigation. Pages have a distance from the active page. While some controls limit the distance to just `0..1`, others, like a `PageControl`, allow for pages to have a distance greater than `1` away. By default this trigger reaches progress 1 when the page reaches a distance of 1, anything greater than 1 will not further modify the trigger.\n\nThe `Scale` property allows changing that mapping. For example, a scale of `0.5` would mean that a page must reach a distance of 2 away from the active one before the trigger reaches a progress of 1.\n\nSee [Navigation Order](articles:navigation/navigationorder.md)"
