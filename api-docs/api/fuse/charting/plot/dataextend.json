It will however also include the the two items before the size shown, and the 1 after it. This will result in items being displayed beyond the edges of the chart, which can be employed for various visual effects.\n\nOne such effect would be a `ClipToBounds=\"true\"` on a `Curve`. This would you to have the curve extend completely to the edges of the chart instead of ending at the visible data set."
