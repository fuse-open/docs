Instead of\n\n    <Change Target=\"target.Property\" Value=\"Value\"/>\n\none can do the following:\n\n    <Change target.Property=\"Value\"/>\n\n# Example\n\nAs with other animators, you can also specify a `Duration`:\n\n    <Panel ux:Name=\"panel\" Color=\"#000\">\n        <WhilePressed>\n            <Change panel.Color=\"#fff\" Duration=\"0.5\" />\n        </WhilePressed>\n    </Panel>\n\nIf the value is continuous this will result in a continously interpolated change in value.\nIf the value cannot be continuously animated, the value will change discretely."

        "full": "Scales the element. Note that scale doesn't actually change the elements size. This means that the rest of the UI layout wont be affected and the animation is guaranteed to be fast.\n\nYou can scale an element uniformly along all axes by using the `Factor` property. Alternatively, you can also scale on a per-axis basis using `Vector` or `X`, `Y`, and `Z`.\n\n**Tip**: You can use `Scale` relative to something using the `RelativeTo` property. The two choices are:\n\n* `SizeChange` - scales relative to the change in size of the element specified by the `RelativeNode` property.\n* `SizeFactor` - scales with a factor relative to another element, specified by `RelativeNode`. A factor of `1` would make it the same size as the `RelativeNode`, while a factor of `0.5` would make it half the size, and so on.\n\n# Example\nThe following example scales a rectangle when it is being pressed\n\n    <Rectangle>\n        <WhilePressed>\n            <Scale Factor=\"2\" Duration=\"0.4\"/>\n        </WhilePressed>\n    </Rectangle>"
